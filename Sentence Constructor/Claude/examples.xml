      Let's help you translate this sentence into Quebec French. I'll provide you with the vocabulary, sentence structure, and some clues to guide you.

      ### Vocabulary Table:
      | French | Quebec Pronunciation | English |
      |--------|----------------------|---------|
      | où | "oo" | where |
      | meilleur | "may-yeur" | best |
      | endroit | "on-drwa" | place |
      | apporter | "ap-por-tay" | to bring |
      | poussette | "poo-set" | baby stroller |
      | jour | "joor" | day |
      | pluvieux | "ploo-vyeu" | rainy |

      ### Sentence Structure:
      [question word] + [verb être] + [article] + [adjective] + [noun] + [preposition] + [verb infinitive] + [article] + [noun] + [preposition] + [article] + [noun] + [adjective]?

      ### Clues and Considerations:
      * Remember that in Quebec French, the question structure often follows similar patterns to English
      * You'll need to use the present tense of "être" (to be)
      * Think about which articles (le, la, les, un, une) to use with each noun
      * Consider which prepositions to use (à, pour, dans, etc.)
      * In Quebec French, adjectives typically follow the noun they describe, except for certain common adjectives
      * Remember that "rainy day" requires you to put the adjective after the noun
      * Try forming the sentence piece by piece using the vocabulary and structure provided

    <score>7</score>
    <score_reason>
      This response scores a 7 because it follows the teaching format with vocabulary, sentence structure, and clues. It adapts well to the unexpected request by still maintaining the French language teaching framework. However, it could have included more Quebec-specific expressions and provided more guidance on how imperative forms work in Quebec French specifically. The response appropriately recognized the dual nature of the request (both XML help and language learning).
